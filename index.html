          Started in 1951 by the National Society of Professional Engineers, Engineer's Week highlights
          engineers' contributions for social good on the second week of February. E-Week is observed by 
          a plethora of professional and academic societies as well as corporations and government agencies. 
          <br>
          <br>
          At UIUC, E-Week is celebrated through a friendly competition, where over 300 students 
          and over 40 societies annually participate. 5 or 10 man teams engage in events and 
          challenges for points, competing for the E-Week Champion title at the end of the week. 
          E-Week's activities center around a different theme every year. This year, the theme 
          is <b>Dark Fantasy.</b>

      <button class="accordion">How Do I Register?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>We have a sign-up form live. When you have all members of your team confirmed to participate, 
            you will need each member's netID and name. Once you sign-up with one team, 
            that is your team. NO EXCEPTIONS. Teams will not be able to be modified past the 
            sign-up deadline because we create brackets right after the deadline.

        <button class="accordion">How Many People are in a Team?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The amount of people you can have on a team depends on if you plan to be a 10-person 
            or 5-person team. 5-person teams are allowed 5 players, with a 6th person to be used 
            as an alternate. 10-person teams are allowed 10 players, with 2 more to be used as alternates.</p>

        <button class="accordion">What are the Prizes?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>RSO teams have the chance to win funding from Engineering Council, while Non-RSO teams have 
            the chance to win various prizes. In the past, we've had non-RSO teams win gift baskets and more!</p>

        <button class="accordion">What are some of the Events?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Events consist of recurring events that have seen great popularity in previous years, as well as new
            thematic events every year. One such recurring event is Amazing Race, where teams are given clues and 
            activities to complete around the UIUC campus in hopes to finish the fastest for team points. 
            This year, new events include Sword and Shield, where teams go head to head in a fast-paced "duel,"
            or Steal the Dragon's Egg, where teams navigate an obstacle-laden hallway to retrieve the egg as fast as possible.</p>
